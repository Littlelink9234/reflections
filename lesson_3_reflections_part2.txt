When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - You would want to create a remote repository when you want to share your work publicly, have others contribute to your project, and when you would want to keep a version of all your work somewhere safe.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  - The amount of overhead when you pull automatically will be high.  You may want to perform a single pull at the end of the day instead of having to do multiple pulls in one day, hour, etc.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  - Fork: Cloning/copying a user's repository.  Use this if you want to work on someone elses project but dont have permission to change their project.
  - Clone: Creating a copy of a repository onto your local machine.  Also creating a copy of a local repository into another place on your local machine.  Use this when you want to work locally on your machine and when a branch is not needed.
  - Branch: Creating a copy of an instance of a commit and all commits that are attached to that branch on your local machine.  Use this when you dont want to disturb the master branch of a project and when you want to make changes to your own branch.
